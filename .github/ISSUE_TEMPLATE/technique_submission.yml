      description: The core idea in 3â€“6 bullets.
      placeholder: |
        - LLM queries metrics via semantic layer APIs; no direct SQL generation
        - Tooling enforces business calendars and SCD2
        - Deterministic retries + caching for external APIs

    attributes:
      label: Input/Output contract
      description: What metadata or components must exist? What does it return?
      placeholder: |
        Requires: dbt semantic layer, metrics YAML, SLA policy doc store.
        Returns: SQL or metric results with citations to applied policies.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: requirements
    attributes:
      label: Dependencies & environment
      description: Libraries/services, dialects, data engines; any version constraints.
      placeholder: |
        dbt=1.7+, Snowflake/BigQuery, OpenAI function calling, Redis cache
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: textarea
    id: evaluation
    attributes:
      label: Observed results / claims
      description: Any empirical results, wins/failures, or expected tradeoffs.
      placeholder: |
        On ~200 internal queries, 90% accuracy on standard metrics; weaker on exploratory tasks.

    id: limits
    attributes:
      label: Known limitations
      description: Where it struggles or is out of scope.
      placeholder: |
        Requires well-defined metrics; cross-metric math with different grains is tricky.
