# Triage & Workflow

1) **Auto-label** by template → `type:*`, `needs: triage`
2) Manually set `category:*` (or rely on the form content + labeler)
3) If info is missing, add `needs:*` labels and comment with a checklist
4) When ready, set `status: accepted`
5) UCB synthesis starts → `status: in synthesis`
6) Evaluation complete → `status: evaluated`
7) Public write-up → `status: published`

**SLA**: Aim to first-respond within 3 business days.
